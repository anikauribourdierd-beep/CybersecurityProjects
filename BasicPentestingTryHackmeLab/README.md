# **TryHackMe – Basic Pentesting**

## **🏁 Objective**

This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of penetration testing by following a realistic attack path. The lab covers enumeration, misconfiguration discovery, lateral movement, credential cracking, and manual privilege escalation.

---

## **🛠️ Skills Practiced**

* Network and service enumeration (Nmap, SMB enumeration)
* Manual Linux enumeration (users, permissions, cron jobs, SUID binaries)
* SSH authentication and key-based access
* Lateral movement between users
* Offline password cracking with John the Ripper
* Privilege escalation methodology (manual, tool-less)

---

## **🧰 Tools Used**

* **Nmap** – This command is a network scanning tool. The purpose is to identify open ports and identify which are exposed. This command was used to map the attack surface of the machine and identify which ports were not insecure.
* **enum4linux** – This is a tool use to collect information from Windows computers over SMB and list what the system shares such as: user names,domain names...
* **smbclient** – smbclient it lets interacts with windows shared folders from linux.
* **Hydra** – This is a credential brute forcing or password guessing tool.
* **John the Ripper** – Crack encrypted SSH key and find weak passwords
* **Linux built-in utilities** – `ls`, `find`, `cat`, `sudo`, `id`
* **linPEAS** - This script is designed to automated checker for linux weakness

---

## **🧭 Methodology**

### **1. 🔍 Enumeration**

* Discovered open services using Nmap
* Identified SMB and SSH as potential attack vectors
* Enumerated SMB users and shares

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/01-nmap-scan.png` – Full port and service discovery
* `screenshots/02-smb-enumeration.png` – SMB user and share enumeration

---

### **2. 🔑 Initial Access**

* Gained SSH access as user **jan**
* Verified identity and permissions using:

  * `whoami`
  * `id`
  * `groups`

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/03-ssh-jan-access.png` – Successful SSH login as jan
* `screenshots/04-identity-verification.png` – User and group validation

---

### **3. 🔍 Manual Enumeration (No linPEAS)**

Automated enumeration tools were unavailable, so privilege escalation checks were performed manually:

* Checked sudo permissions
* Enumerated cron jobs
* Searched for SUID binaries
* Enumerated home directories

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/05-sudo-check.png` – Sudo permission check
* `screenshots/06-suid-enumeration.png` – SUID binary discovery
* `screenshots/07-home-directory-enum.png` – Home directory enumeration

---

### **4. 🔀 Lateral Movement**

* Discovered the **kay** user directory
* Found an exposed SSH private key in `/home/kay/.ssh/`
* Copied the encrypted private key for offline analysis

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/08-kay-ssh-key.png` – Exposed SSH private key discovery

---

### **5. 🔓 Credential Cracking**

* Converted the SSH key using `ssh2john`
* Cracked the passphrase using John the Ripper with the `rockyou` wordlist
* Successfully authenticated as **kay** using SSH key authentication

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/09-ssh2john.png` – SSH key converted for John
* `screenshots/10-john-cracked.png` – Passphrase successfully cracked

---

### **6. ✅ Final Access**

* Logged in as user **kay**
* Retrieved the final password stored in kay’s home directory

**📸 Screenshots**

* `screenshots/11-ssh-kay-access.png` – SSH access as kay
* `screenshots/12-final-password.png` – Final password

## 🧗‍♀️⚙️ Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them

* **VPN connection issues:** I fixed the VPN issue by correcting the OpenVPN file path, rerunning the `sudo openvpn` command, and confirming the connection using `ping` and `nmap -sn`.

* **Enumeration tools not found or failing:** When `enum4linux` didn’t work due to path errors, I located the tool properly and relied on Nmap service scans to continue enumeration.

* **SMB enumeration not returning results:** Since `smbclient` did not return any useful output, I verified SMB was running with Nmap and pivoted to other enumeration techniques.

* **Wordlist path issues:** I resolved the `rockyou.txt` error by locating and decompressing the wordlist and updating the correct file path in my brute‑force command.

* **linPEAS not installing:** When linPEAS failed to install or download, I continued privilege escalation by manually enumerating users, groups, file permissions, and SUID binaries.

* **SSH access troubleshooting:** I fixed SSH login issues by confirming the correct target IP, verifying the SSH service was open, and rechecking the username before reconnecting.
